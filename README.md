I have years of experience as an engineer/technician and I have worked with the World Health Organization for so many years and I must say I am proud to have a chance to work with the World Health Organization as a senior engineer/technician. It has not been an easy route with everything but in any where you find yourself you have to corporate which will always add more and more experience to your work knowledge.
